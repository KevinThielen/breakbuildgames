# About Me
I'm just a wannabe game developer from Germany, just starting his 30's, working on other peoples games since 2014, and a full time freelancer since 2018. I have been using C++ and C# professionally for almost a decade at this point.
I watch way too many cartoons([MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/profile/GenusNymphicus)), like graphics programming, am into SRPG's and card games, and I'm pretty much addicted to the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language nowadays.

My setup is [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) with the [i3 window manager](https://i3wm.org/), and I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) for pretty much everything.

# About This Site
My goal is and has always been to make my own games. I decided to log my journey as I go, to share my progress, thoughts and get feedback. From writing a simple renderer to actual games. I will share how I approach and solve problems, write down alternative approaches I considered, and reasons why I decided against them and similar things. Basically making the entire process a transparent as possible. This also means that every single line of code I'm writing for this project will be Open Source.

If you ever find any errors, be it factual or grammar ones, or have any
questions, please open an issue on this repository and contact me via any of the
social media links at the bottom of this site. Read the
[contribution](support#contribution) page for further information.


This site is using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org) and based on the amazing and lightweight [Abridge](https://abridge.netlify.app/) theme.
